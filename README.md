# VSB - Virtual Soft Button

## Overview

A simple , safe  and easy softKeys ( navigation bar).

This project just was used for my device to solve hardware button problem.
If you have any idea for any thing, please let me know!


## Features

VSB will put a invisible button at the bottom of your screen. It will be there at anytime, even when the keyboard is open. So be careful when typing. The button has several functions:&lt;br>&lt;br>

* (Double) Touch: trigger a regular "home button" press.
* Swipe left: trigger a regular "back button" press
* Swipe right: trigger a regular "recent button" press.
* Swipe up: open notifications.
